<!-- ...and I work to enable the next one billion developers. -->
<p>&hellip;and I work for the next generation of makers.</p>
<!-- Ever since my first hackathon _a long time ago_, I have fostered a hacker-first mentality. -->
<p>Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is ubiquitious and every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However, <strong>today&rsquo;s world isn&rsquo;t designed to work for these makers</strong> creating an imbalance between the impact they&rsquo;re capable of, and what&rsquo;s expected of them.</p>
<p>I’m working to solve this problem…</p>
<ul>
<li>by creating better <strong>tools</strong> at <a href="https://sdui.de" target="_blank">Sdui</a> for education and formerly at <a href="https://hackerbay.com" target="_blank">Hackerbay</a> for hackers and companies;</li>
<li>by building <strong>communities</strong>, formerly as co-founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065333/https:/hackevents.co/" target="_blank">Hackevents</a> organizing hackathons across Germany, now by mentoring at hackathons around the world;</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and through one commit at a time.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working as <strong>Head of Engineering</strong> at <a href="https://sdui.de" target="_blank">Sdui</a>. It&rsquo;s an amazing gig where I get to work alongside great developers on a software product that has become an integral medium upon which tens of thousands of teachers, parents and students rely to guarantee essential communication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently <strong>living in Helsinki, Finland</strong>. Some other places I&rsquo;ve lived in are Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Munich.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge physics nerd, in particular cosmology. I wrote about the accelerating expansion of the universe, or better know as Dark Energy <a href="posts/dark-energy">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="previously">Previously</h2>
<p>I founded and built <a href="https://hackerbay" target="_blank">Hackerbay</a> as CTO with three awesome friends. We took a small insight from hackathons – <em>software is not a 12 month development cycle</em> – and built up a B2B company. We worked with Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz and some of Germany&rsquo;s largest corporations. With <a href="https://nfx.com" target="_blank">NFX</a> we had incredible investors on board and always an open ear from James, Pete, or Gigi.</p>
<p>After five years of immense personal and professional growth, priorities changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities, where each of our personal strengths are best put to use.</p>
<p>For me that&rsquo;s <strong>building tools for enabling the next billion developers</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="lets-connect">Let&rsquo;s connect</h2>
<p>I’m most active on <a href="https://twitter.com/mfts0" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mfts" target="_blank">GitHub</a> but you can also find me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/marcseitz" class="bar" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. The best way to contact me is either through Twitter, or my email at my first name @ mfts.io – my DMs and inbox are always open.</p>
